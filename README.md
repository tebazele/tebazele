### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jeanne Allen. I'm a graduate of Boise CodeWorks and a full-stack developer. Currently, I work as a teaching assistant at CodeWorks and love teaching others about software. I love solving problems with real-world implications, and come from a background in marketing and writing for small businesses. Before starting at CodeWorks, I co-owned CraftRanker, a small business coaching other small-time sellers on how to sell effectively online, and I published two books on Amazon on the same topic. As a small business owner, I've worn lots of hats, including building the company website, writing search-engine-optimized copy, helping customers with tech support, and managing social media marketing and email marketing. 

I love helping small companies build their businesses from the ground up. My passion is building websites that cater to the user experience and generate happy, loyal customers who love not only the product but the company that created it. 

I've always loved teaching others the skills that I've learned and seeing them succeed. Through CraftRanker, I was able to help hundreds of online sellers make their dreams come true, and working one-on-one with these dedicated, hardworking people was one of my favorite parts of my job. 

I'm hoping to continue working in software development in a way that allows me to work with other passionate people and continue learning new langauges and frameworks. 

Tech Stack: Javascript(Vue.js), Node.js, Mongo.db, CSS/Bootstrap, HTML.
